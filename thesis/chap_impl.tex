\chapter{Proposed implementation}
\label{chap:impl}

My goal is to design and implement library for \acrlong{acc:ea}, as mentioned in the chapter \ref{chap:eva}. The library should not only implement existing \acrshortpl{acc:ea} and allow to execute them on the \gpuns, but also afford general framework to which it would be simple to plug new algorithms.
