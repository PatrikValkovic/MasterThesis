  abstract = {In this paper, a class of weighted vector directional filters (WVDFs) based on the selection of the output sample from the multichannel input set is analyzed and optimized. The WVDF output minimizes the sum of weighted angular distances to other input samples from the filtering window. Dependent on the weighting coefficients, the class of the WVDFs can be designed to perform a number of smoothing operations with different properties, which can be applied for specific filtering scenarios. In order to adapt the weighting coefficients to varying noise and image statistics, we introduce a methodology, which achieves an optimal trade-off between smoothing and detail preserving characteristics. The proposed angular optimization algorithms take advantage of adaptive stack filters design and weighted median filtering framework. The optimized WVDFs are able to remove image noise, while maintaining excellent signal-detail preservation capabilities and sufficient robustness for a variety of signal and noise statistics.}

  abstract  = {In this paper, a new selection scheme for (μ + 1) a steady-state evolution strategy is described: the so-called median selection. In contrast to generational algorithms, only one individual is generated and evaluated in one step of the algorithm and is immediately integrated into the population. Previous steady-state algorithms are similar to the (μ + λ) selection scheme in evolution strategies, which has a disadvantage in the fast self-adaptation of mutation step-length. This is compensated by the presented median selection, which is oriented at the (μ, λ) selection. The median selection is compared with other steady-state selection schemes and with (μ, λ) selection. As a result, median selection achieves better or equally good results as the other selection schemes for a large number of benchmark functions. Additionally, it is shown that the use of a sequential steady-state evolution strategy is advantageous even on one-processor computers.},

In addition, we present an analysis of the effectiveness of the GPU as a compute engine compared to the CPU, to determine when the GPU can outperform the CPU for a particular algorithm. We evaluate our system with five applications, the SAXPY and SGEMV BLAS operators, image segmentation, FFT, and ray tracing. For these applications, we demonstrate that our Brook implementations perform comparably to hand-written GPU code and up to seven times faster than their CPU counterparts.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an effective new island model genetic algorithm to solve the well-known job shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the makespan. To improve the effectiveness of the classical island model genetic algorithm, we have proposed a new naturally inspired evolution model and a new naturally inspired migration selection mechanism that are capable of improving the search diversification and delaying the premature convergence. In the proposed evolution model, islands employ different evolution methods during their self-adaptation phases, rather than employing the same methods. In the proposed migration selection mechanism, worst individuals who are least adapted to their environments migrate first, hoping in finding a better chance to live in a more suitable environment that imposes a more suitable self-adaptation method on them. The proposed algorithm is tested on 52 benchmark instances, with the proposed evolution model and migration selection mechanism, and without them using the classical alternatives, and also compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature. Computational results verify the improvements achieved by the proposed evolution model and migration selection mechanism, and show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the others in terms of effectiveness.}
