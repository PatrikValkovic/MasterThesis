\def\Abstract{%
\acrlongpl*{acc:gpu} stand for the success of \acrlong*{acc:ai} over the past decade and its broader application in the industry. Another promising field of \acrlong*{acc:ai} is \acrlong*{acc:ea}. Their parallelization ability is well known and has been successfully applied in practice. However, these attempts focused on multi--core and multi--machine parallelization rather than on the \acrshort*{acc:gpu}.\\
This work explores the possibilities of \acrlong*{acc:ea} parallelization on \acrshort*{acc:gpu}. I propose implementation in PyTorch library, allowing execution of \acrshort*{acc:ea} on \acrshort*{acc:gpu}. The proposed implementation provides the most common evolutionary operators for \acrlongpl*{acc:ga}, Real--Coded Evolutionary Algorithms, and \acrlong*{acc:pso} Algorithms. Finally, I show the performance is an order of magnitude faster on \acrshort*{acc:gpu} for medium and big--sized problems and populations.
