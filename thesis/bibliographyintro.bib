  abstract = {We describe the approach that won the final phase of the German traffic sign recognition benchmark. Our method is the only one that achieved a better-than-human recognition rate of 99.46%. We use a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that does not require careful design of pre-wired feature extractors, which are rather learned in a supervised way. Combining various DNNs trained on differently preprocessed data into a Multi-Column DNN (MCDNN) further boosts recognition performance, making the system insensitive also to variations in contrast and illumination.}

  abstract = {A method is described for designing speaker recognition features that are robust to telephone handset distortion. The approach transforms features such as mel-cepstral features, log spectrum, and prosody-based features with a non-linear artificial neural network. The neural network is discriminatively trained to maximize speaker recognition performance specifically in the setting of telephone handset mismatch between training and testing. The algorithm requires neither stereo recordings of speech during training nor manual labeling of handset types either in training or testing. Results on the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Speaker Recognition Evaluation corpus show relative improvements as high as 28% for the new multilayered perceptron (MLP)-based features as compared to a standard mel-cepstral feature set with cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) and handset-dependent normalizing impostor models.
Zusammenfassung
Der Artikel beschreibt eine Methode zur Bestimmung von Merkmalen zur Sprechererkennung, die robust gegen Verzerrung durch den Telephonhörer sind. In unserem Verfahren werden die Merkmale, wie z.B. Mel-Cepstrum, logarithmisches Spektrum, oder prosodische Merkmale, durch ein nicht-lineares künstliches neuronales Netz transformiert. Das neuronale Netz wird diskriminativ darauf trainiert, die Sprechererkennungsrate bei unterschiedlichen Telephonhörern im Training und Test zu maximieren. Der Algorithmus braucht weder Stereo-Sprachaufzeichnungen im Training, noch bedarf er manueller Feststellung des Hörertyps im Training oder Test. Die Ergebnisse auf dem 1998 NIST Sprechererkennungskorpus zeigen eine relative Verbesserung von bis zu 28% durch die neuen neuronalen-Netz-Merkale, verglichen mit gewöhnlichen Mel-Cepstrum-Merkmalen, Subtraktion der Cepstrum-Mittelwerte und hörerspezifischen normalisierenden Impostor-Modellen.
Résumé
Une méthode est décrite pour l'extraction de vecteurs de caractéristiques robustes aux distortions provenant du type de téléphone utilisé dans des applications de reconnaissance du locuteur. La technique transforme les vecteurs de caractéristiques tels que le Mel-cepstre, le log-spectre et les caractéristiques basées sur la prosodie, à l'aide de réseau de neurones non-linéaire. Le réseau de neurones est entraı&#x0302;né de manière discriminante pour maximiser la performance du système de reconnaissance du locuteur, spécifiquement dans des conditions où des types de téléphone différents sont utilisés lors de l'entraı&#x0302;nement et de la vérification. L'algorithme ne requiert, ni enregistrement stéréo de la session d'entraı&#x0302;nement, ni étiquettage manuel des types de téléphone utilisés à l'entraı&#x0302;nement et à la vérification. Les résultats sur le corpus 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation montrent une amélioration relative atteignant 28% avec les nouvelles caractéristiques basées sur le réseau de neurones. Le système de référence utilise des vecteurs de caractéristiques basés le MEL-cepstre avec soustraction du cepstre moyen ainsi que des modèles d'imposteurs dépendant du type de téléphone.}

  abstract  = {Data-driven methods for physical simulation are an attractive option for interactive applications due to their ability to trade precomputation and memory footprint in exchange for improved runtime performance. Yet, existing data-driven methods fall short of the extreme memory and performance constraints imposed by modern interactive applications like AAA games and virtual reality. Here, performance budgets for physics simulation range from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds per frame, per object. We present a data-driven physical simulation method that meets these constraints. Our method combines subspace simulation techniques with machine learning which, when coupled, enables a very efficient subspace-only physics simulation that supports interactions with external objects - a longstanding challenge for existing subspace techniques. We also present an interpretation of our method as a special case of subspace Verlet integration, where we apply machine learning to efficiently approximate the physical forces of the system directly in the subspace. We propose several practical solutions required to make effective use of such a model, including a novel training methodology required for prediction stability, and a GPU-friendly subspace decompression algorithm to accelerate rendering.},

  abstract   = {Interactive control of self-balancing, physically simulated humanoids is a long standing problem in the field of real-time character animation. While physical simulation guarantees realistic interactions in the virtual world, simulated characters can appear unnatural if they perform unusual movements in order to maintain balance. Therefore, obtaining a high level of responsiveness to user control, runtime performance, and diversity has often been overlooked in exchange for motion quality. Recent work in the field of deep reinforcement learning has shown that training physically simulated characters to follow motion capture clips can yield high quality tracking results. We propose a two-step approach for building responsive simulated character controllers from unstructured motion capture data. First, meaningful features from the data such as movement direction, heading direction, speed, and locomotion style, are interactively specified and drive a kinematic character controller implemented using motion matching. Second, reinforcement learning is used to train a simulated character controller that is general enough to track the entire distribution of motion that can be generated by the kinematic controller. Our design emphasizes responsiveness to user input, visual quality, and low runtime cost for application in video-games.},

  abstract  = {Given the complexity of the problem, genetic algorithms are one of the more promising methods of discovering control schemes for soft robotics. Since physically embodied evolution is time consuming and expensive, an outstanding challenge lies in developing fast and suitably realistic simulations in which to evolve soft robot gaits. We describe two parallel methods of using NVidia's PhysX, a hardware-accelerated (GPGPU) physics engine, in order to evolve and optimize soft bodied gaits. The first method involves the evolution of open-loop gaits using a reduced-order lumped parameter model. The second method involves harnessing PhysX's soft-bodied material simulation capabilites. In each case we discuss the the challenges and possibilities involved in using the PhysX for evolutionary soft robotics.},

  abstract = {In this study, a new mutation operator has been developed to increase Genetic Algorithm (GA) performance to find the shortest distance in the known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We called this method as Greedy Sub Tour Mutation (GSTM). There exist two different greedy search methods and a component that provides a distortion in this new operator. The developed GSTM operator was tested with simple GA mutation operators in 14 different TSP examples selected from TSPLIB. The application of this GSTM operator gives much more effective results regarding to the best and average error values. The GSTM operator used with simple GAs decreases the best error values according to the other mutation operators with the ratio of between 74.24% and 88.32% and average error values between 59.42% and 79.51%.}

  abstract   = {An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},
