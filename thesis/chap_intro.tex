\chapter{Introduction}

\acrfull{acc:ai} has become phenomenon of these days. Latest advances in this field achieved magnificent results and allowed creation of systems and tools, we though would be possible thirty years back. The biggest credit goes to the \acrfull{acc:ann}, which allowed this rapid and astonishing growth of the field. More precisely, the \acrfull{acc:dann} sparkled this process in 2011, when they started to exceed human performance in German traffic sign recognition benchmark \cite{CIRESAN2012333}.

Although industrial applications has been known before, like checks processing at the beginning of 2020s \cite{ChecksDocumentRecognition}, and speaker recognition \cite{HECK2000181}, it were successes in 2011 and 2012 that get closer attention of academia and broader community. The progress is getting at pace since then and we can see new results on a daily basis. Current state-of-the-art system already exceed human performance and traditional methods in number of various tasks -- like image recognition \cite{pham2021meta}\cite{ZawadzkaGosk2019}, object detection \cite{ghiasi2020simple}\cite{lehner2019patch}, natural language processing \cite{gpt3}, video editing \cite{lu2020layered}, question answering \cite{yamada2020luke}\cite{yamada2020luke}, and many more. Thanks to the rise of generative models, results in the field of image synthesis \cite{StateOfTheArtImageSythesis} \cite{esser2020taming}\cite{dalle}, super-resolution \cite{Sun_2020}\linebreak\cite{Chadha_2020}, text generation \cite{gpt3}\cite{malmi2019encode},\linebreak and countless more amaze scientists with accuracy and attention to details.

\acrshort{acc:ann} find their way into fields, that traditional machine learning methods have not consider -- fluid simulation \cite{um2018liquid}\cite{Kim_2019}, cloth simulation \cite{lee2019efficient}\cite{SRBO20}, or even whole physics \cite{PhysicsSimulation}\cite{sanchezgonzalez2020learning} and movement of virtual entities \cite{PhysicsBasedCharaterSImulation}\cite{zhang2020vid2player}. Because of that, \acrshort{acc:ann} are used in robotics \cite{pierson2017deep}\cite{Lee_2020},Hollywood \cite{aiinhollywood},  healthcare \cite{fakoor2013using}\cite{BreastCancerAISystem}, and learning computer games \cite{openai2019dota}\cite{alphastar}.
